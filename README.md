# classification-analysis

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts required to reproduce the results shown in [Data Efficiency of Classification Strategies for Chemical and Materials Design](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1sspf).

Every figure can be reproduced using the script with the appropriate name ([fig3.py](fig3.py) recreates Figure 3). We also include the script [prep_metafeatures.py](prep_metafeatures.py) that downselects the set of unique and uncorrelated metafeatures (stored in [metafeatures.pickle](metafeatures.pickle)) used in the sequential feature addition conducted in [sfa_and_fig8.py](sfa_and_fig8.py).

[results.pickle](results.pickle) is a dictionary that contains the performances of all seeds of all classification strategies on all tasks. The dictionary is structured by task, algorithm type, sampler, model, and seed. Therefore, results['qm9_cv']['al']['medoids']['nn'][24] contains a numpy array of the performances of of the 24th seed of (AL, Medoids, NN) applied to classification of heat capacities in QM9. The numpy array is a 2D array of shape (11,4) where the first axis corresponds to rounds of active learning (0-10) and the second axis includes the round number, balanced accuracy, Macro F~1, and Matthew Correlation Coefficient, in that order.
